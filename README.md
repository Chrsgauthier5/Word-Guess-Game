# Word-Guess-Game
HW3 Hangman
This is a hangman style word guess game that I made.

It utilizes HTML/CSS/JavaScript.  

Some cool features that it has are the ability to validate user input!
  - Users won't be able to enter a letter they have already guessed
  - Users won't be able to enter something that is not a letter (number / symbol)
  
 This game also lets you see what the word was if you don't get it correctly in the alloted number of guesses.
 
 The guess logic exists such that you get (length of word * 1.5) = guesses.  The only issue i see with this is that is not based on unique letters.  The word 'Banana' would be much easier than "Orange" because Banana has 'a' and 'n' multiple times.
